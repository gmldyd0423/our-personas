## 🤔 What is Spec-Driven Development?

Spec-Driven Development (SDD) reverses the traditional coding hierarchy. Instead of specifications being mere guides, they become **executable assets** that directly generate working implementations. Code no longer precedes the spec; the spec is the implementation.

## ⚡ Get Started

### 1. Install Personas CLI

Choose your preferred installation method:

#### Option 1: Persistent Installation (Recommended)

Install once and use everywhere:

```bash
uv tool install personas-cli --from git+https://github.com/dauquangthanh/our-personas.git
```

Then use the tool directly:

```bash
personas init <PROJECT_NAME>
personas check
```

To upgrade personas run:

```bash
uv tool install personas-cli --force --from git+https://github.com/dauquangthanh/our-personas.git
```

#### Option 2: One-time Usage

Run directly without installing:

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/dauquangthanh/our-personas.git personas init <PROJECT_NAME>
```

**Benefits of persistent installation:**

- Tool stays installed and available in PATH
- No need to create shell aliases
- Better tool management with `uv tool list`, `uv tool upgrade`, `uv tool uninstall`
- Cleaner shell configuration

### 2. Establish project principles

Launch your AI assistant in the project directory. The `/personas.*` commands are available in the assistant.

Use the **`/personas.regulate`** command to create your project's governing principles and development guidelines that will guide all subsequent development.

```bash
/personas.regulate Create principles focused on code quality, testing standards, user experience consistency, and performance requirements
```

### 3. Define system overview (recommended for new projects)

Before diving into individual features, create a comprehensive system overview that lists all planned features and high-level requirements. This is especially important for greenfield projects where you need to design the architecture based on the complete feature set.

```bash
/personas.specify Create a comprehensive system overview for [your project name].

FEATURES:
1. [Feature 1 name and brief description]
2. [Feature 2 name and brief description]
3. [Feature 3 name and brief description]
...

HIGH-LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:
- Expected scale (users, data volume, concurrent operations)
- Performance targets
- Security requirements
- Compliance needs
- Integration requirements

This system overview will guide architecture decisions in the next step.
```

This creates a "Feature 001" specification (`.personas/specs/001-system-overview/spec.md`) that serves as the foundation for architectural design. You can skip this step if you're adding features to an existing system with established architecture.

### 4. Create feature specifications

Use the **`/personas.specify`** command to describe what you want to build. Focus on the **what** and **why**, not the tech stack.

```bash
/personas.specify Build an application that can help me organize my photos in separate photo albums. Albums are grouped by date and can be re-organized by dragging and dropping on the main page. Albums are never in other nested albums. Within each album, photos are previewed in a tile-like interface.
```

**Note**: For individual features in an existing project, use `/personas.specify` as shown above. For new projects, consider creating a system overview first (see Step 3).

### 5. Clarify requirements (optional but recommended)

Use **`/personas.clarify`** to resolve any ambiguities in your specification before planning.

```bash
/personas.clarify
```

### 6. Define system architecture

Use **`/personas.architect`** to establish your system's overall architecture, components, and infrastructure. **This step is critical for new projects and should be based on your system overview (Feature 001) if you created one.**

```bash
/personas.architect Design a single-page application with local storage, using a modular component architecture with clear separation between UI and data layers
```

For larger systems with multiple features defined in your system overview:

```bash
/personas.architect Based on the features in specs/001-system-overview/spec.md, design a system architecture using:
- Microservices for: [list key services based on your features]
- API Gateway for routing
- [Database choice] for data persistence
- [Cache/messaging technologies]
- [Deployment strategy]

Include component interactions, data flows, and scalability considerations for the expected load.
```

### 7. Establish coding standards

Use **`/personas.standardize`** to define coding practices, testing requirements, and quality standards.

```bash
/personas.standardize Configure standards for vanilla JavaScript with ESLint, 80% test coverage using Vitest, and Prettier formatting
```

### 7. Create a technical implementation plan

Use the **`/personas.design`** command to provide your tech stack and architecture choices.

```bash
/personas.design The application uses Vite with minimal number of libraries. Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as much as possible. Images are not uploaded anywhere and metadata is stored in a local SQLite database.
```

### 8. Generate E2E test spec

Use **`/personas.design-test`** to create a comprehensive E2E test spec based on user workflows from your quickstart guide.

```bash
/personas.design-test
```

### 9. Break down into tasks

Use **`/personas.taskify`** to create an actionable task list from your implementation plan.

```bash
/personas.taskify
```

### 10. Analyze for consistency (optional but recommended)

Use **`/personas.analyze`** to validate consistency across all artifacts before implementation.

```bash
/personas.analyze
```

### 11. Execute implementation

Use **`/personas.implement`** to execute all tasks and build your feature according to the plan.

```bash
/personas.implement
```

### 12. Execute E2E tests

Use **`/personas.test`** to run E2E tests according to your test spec and generate a comprehensive test report.

```bash
/personas.test
```

For detailed step-by-step instructions, see our [comprehensive guide](./spec-driven.md).

## 🤖 Supported AI Agents

Our Personas supports **multiple AI agents simultaneously**. You can select one or more agents during initialization, and the CLI will set up the appropriate command structures for each selected agent.

## 📚 Core Philosophy

Spec-Driven Development is a structured process that emphasizes:

- **Intent-driven development** where specifications define the "*what*" before the "*how*"
- **Rich specification creation** using guardrails and organizational principles
- **Multi-step refinement** rather than one-shot code generation from prompts
- **Heavy reliance** on advanced AI model capabilities for specification interpretation

## 🌟 Development Phases

|-------|-------|----------------|
| **0-to-1 Development** ("Greenfield") | Generate from scratch | <ul><li>Start with high-level requirements</li><li>Generate specifications</li><li>Plan implementation steps</li><li>Build production-ready applications</li></ul> |
| **Creative Exploration** | Parallel implementations | <ul><li>Explore diverse solutions</li><li>Support multiple technology stacks & architectures</li><li>Experiment with UX patterns</li></ul> |
| **Iterative Enhancement** ("Brownfield") | Brownfield modernization | <ul><li>Add features iteratively</li><li>Modernize legacy systems</li><li>Adapt processes</li></ul> |

## 📋 Detailed Process

<details>
<summary>Click to expand the detailed step-by-step walkthrough</summary>

You can use the Personas CLI to bootstrap your project, which will bring in the required artifacts in your environment. Run:

```bash
personas init <project_name>
```

Or initialize in the current directory:

```bash
personas init .
# or use the --here flag
personas init --here
# Skip confirmation when the directory already has files
personas init . --force
# or
personas init --here --force
```

You will be prompted to select the AI agent you are using. You can also proactively specify it directly in the terminal:

```bash
personas init <project_name> --ai claude
personas init <project_name> --ai gemini
personas init <project_name> --ai copilot

# Or in current directory:
personas init . --ai claude
personas init . --ai codex

# or use --here flag
personas init --here --ai claude
personas init --here --ai codex

# Force merge into a non-empty current directory
personas init . --force --ai claude

# or
personas init --here --force --ai claude
```

The CLI will check if you have Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor CLI, Qwen CLI, opencode, Codex CLI, or Amazon Q Developer CLI installed. If you do not, or you prefer to get the templates without checking for the right tools, use `--ignore-agent-tools` with your command:

```bash
personas init <project_name> --ai claude --ignore-agent-tools
```

### **STEP 1:** Establish project principles

Go to the project folder and run your AI agent. In our example, we're using `claude`.

You will know that things are configured correctly if you see the `/personas.regulate`, `/personas.specify`, `/personas.design`, `/personas.design-test`, `/personas.taskify`, `/personas.test`, and `/personas.implement` commands available.

The first step should be establishing your project's governing principles using the `/personas.regulate` command. This helps ensure consistent decision-making throughout all subsequent development phases:

```text
/personas.regulate Create principles focused on code quality, testing standards, user experience consistency, and performance requirements. Include governance for how these principles should guide technical decisions and implementation choices.
```

This step creates or updates the `.personas/memory/ground-rules.md` file with your project's foundational guidelines that the AI agent will reference during specification, planning, and implementation phases.

### **STEP 2:** Create system overview (recommended for new projects)

For greenfield projects, create a comprehensive system overview before defining architecture. This helps you understand the full scope and design appropriate architecture:

```text
/personas.specify Create "Taskify" - a team productivity platform.

COMPLETE FEATURE LIST:
1. Multi-tenant workspace management
2. User authentication and authorization (roles: admin, PM, engineer)
3. Project management (create, archive, permissions)
4. Kanban boards with drag-and-drop
5. Task management (create, assign, comment, move)
6. Real-time collaboration (live updates, presence)
7. File attachments
8. Search and filtering
9. Activity feed and notifications
10. Analytics dashboard
11. Mobile-responsive UI
12. API for integrations

HIGH-LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:
- Scale: 1000 concurrent users, 10K projects, 100K tasks
- Security: SSO, RBAC, audit logging, data encryption
- Performance: <200ms API response time, real-time updates <100ms latency
- Compliance: GDPR, SOC 2
- Integrations: Slack, Microsoft Teams, Jira

This system overview will guide architecture decisions. Do not implement yet - this is for scoping and architecture planning.
```

This creates `.personas/specs/001-system-overview/spec.md` that serves as the blueprint for your architecture.

**Skip this step** if you're adding features to an existing system with established architecture.

### **STEP 3:** Create individual feature specifications

With your project principles (and optionally system overview) established, you can now create detailed functional specifications for individual features. Use the `/personas.specify` command and then provide the concrete requirements for the feature you want to develop.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Be as explicit as possible about *what* you are trying to build and *why*. **Do not focus on the tech stack at this point**.

An example prompt for an individual feature:

```text
Develop Taskify, a team productivity platform. It should allow users to create projects, add team members,
assign tasks, comment and move tasks between boards in Kanban style. In this initial phase for this feature,
let's call it "Create Taskify," let's have multiple users but the users will be declared ahead of time, predefined.
I want five users in two different categories, one product manager and four engineers. Let's create three
different sample projects. Let's have the standard Kanban columns for the status of each task, such as "To Do,"
"In Progress," "In Review," and "Done." There will be no login for this application as this is just the very
first testing thing to ensure that our basic features are set up. For each task in the UI for a task card,
you should be able to change the current status of the task between the different columns in the Kanban work board.
You should be able to leave an unlimited number of comments for a particular card. You should be able to, from that task
card, assign one of the valid users. When you first launch Taskify, it's going to give you a list of the five users to pick
from. There will be no password required. When you click on a user, you go into the main view, which displays the list of
projects. When you click on a project, you open the Kanban board for that project. You're going to see the columns.
You'll be able to drag and drop cards back and forth between different columns. You will see any cards that are
assigned to you, the currently logged in user, in a different color from all the other ones, so you can quickly
see yours. You can edit any comments that you make, but you can't edit comments that other people made. You can
delete any comments that you made, but you can't delete comments anybody else made.
```

After this prompt is entered, you should see the AI agent kick off the planning and spec drafting process. It will also trigger some of the built-in scripts to set up the repository.

Once this step is completed, you should have a new branch created (e.g., `001-create-taskify`), as well as a new specification in the `specs/001-create-taskify` directory.

The produced specification should contain a set of user stories and functional requirements, as defined in the template.

At this stage, your project folder contents should resemble the following:

```text
└── .personas
    ├── memory
    │  └── ground-rules.md
    ├── scripts
    │  ├── check-prerequisites.sh
    │  ├── common.sh
    │  ├── create-new-feature.sh
    │  ├── setup-design.sh
    │  └── update-agent-context.sh
    ├── specs
    │  └── 001-create-taskify
    │      └── spec.md
    └── templates
        ├── design-template.md
        ├── spec-template.md
        └── tasks-template.md
```

### **STEP 4:** Functional specification clarification (optional but recommended)

With the baseline specification created, you can clarify any requirements that were not captured properly in the first attempt.

You should run the structured clarification workflow **before** defining architecture and planning to reduce rework downstream.

Use `/personas.clarify` for sequential, coverage-based questioning that records answers in a Clarifications section:

```text
/personas.clarify
```

Example additional refinement if needed:

```text
For each sample project or project that you create there should be a variable number of tasks between 5 and 15
tasks for each one randomly distributed into different states of completion. Make sure that there's at least
one task in each stage of completion.
```

You should also ask the AI agent to validate the **Review & Acceptance Checklist**, checking off items that pass the requirements. The following prompt can be used:

```text
Read the review and acceptance checklist, and check off each item in the checklist if the feature spec meets the criteria. Leave it empty if it does not.
```

It's important to use the interaction with the AI agent as an opportunity to clarify and ask questions around the specification - **do not treat its first attempt as final**.

### **STEP 5:** Define system architecture (recommended before planning)

Before creating detailed implementation plans, establish your system's overall architecture using the `/personas.architect` command. **If you created a system overview (Feature 001), base your architecture on those features:**

```text
/personas.architect Based on the features defined in specs/001-system-overview/spec.md, design a system architecture using:
- Microservices: Auth Service, Project Service, Task Service, Notification Service
- API Gateway with authentication/authorization
- PostgreSQL for transactional data
- Redis for caching and real-time presence
- RabbitMQ for asynchronous task processing
- SignalR for real-time updates
- Azure Blob Storage for file attachments
- Kubernetes deployment on Azure

Include:
- Component interaction diagrams
- Data flow patterns
- Scaling strategy (initial: vertical, future: horizontal with service replication)
- Security boundaries and authentication flow
- Performance targets: <200ms API response, <100ms real-time updates
```

For simpler applications without a system overview:

```text
/personas.architect Design a single-page application with local storage, using a modular component architecture with clear separation between UI and data layers.
```

This step creates the `.personas/memory/architecture.md` file that documents:

- System components and their responsibilities
- Technology stack and versions
- Communication patterns between components
- Data architecture and persistence strategy
- Deployment and infrastructure approach
- Quality attribute targets (performance, availability, scalability)

The architecture serves as the technical framework that guides all subsequent implementation planning.

### **STEP 6:** Establish coding standards (recommended before planning)

After defining your architecture, establish consistent coding practices using the `/personas.standardize` command:

```text
/personas.standardize Configure standards for .NET 8 with xUnit for testing, 80% code coverage requirement, 
ESLint for code quality, automated security scanning with OWASP dependency check, and CI/CD pipeline 
with GitHub Actions.
```

This step creates the `.personas/memory/standards.md` file that defines:

- Testing requirements (frameworks, coverage targets, test types)
- Security practices (authentication, authorization, data validation)
- Code quality standards (linters, formatters, complexity limits)
- Documentation requirements
- CI/CD and deployment practices

The standards ensure consistent implementation quality across all features.

### **STEP 7:** Generate a plan

You can now be specific about the tech stack and other technical requirements. You can use the `/personas.design` command that is built into the project template with a prompt like this:

```text
We are going to generate this using .NET Aspire, using Postgres as the database. The frontend should use
Blazor server with drag-and-drop task boards, real-time updates. There should be a REST API created with a projects API,
tasks API, and a notifications API.
```

The output of this step will include a number of implementation detail documents, with your directory tree resembling this:

```text
.
├── CLAUDE.md
├── memory
│  └── ground-rules.md
├── scripts
│  ├── check-prerequisites.sh
│  ├── common.sh
│  ├── create-new-feature.sh
│  ├── setup-design.sh
│  └── update-claude-md.sh
├── specs
│  └── 001-create-taskify
│      ├── contracts
│      │  ├── api-spec.json
│      │  └── signalr-spec.md
│      ├── data-model.md
│      ├── design.md
│      ├── quickstart.md
│      ├── research.md
│      └── spec.md
└── templates
    ├── CLAUDE-template.md
    ├── design-template.md
    ├── spec-template.md
    └── tasks-template.md
```

Check the `research.md` document to ensure that the right tech stack is used, based on your instructions. You can ask Claude Code to refine it if any of the components stand out, or even have it check the locally-installed version of the platform/framework you want to use (e.g., .NET).

Additionally, you might want to ask Claude Code to research details about the chosen tech stack if it's something that is rapidly changing (e.g., .NET Aspire, JS frameworks), with a prompt like this:

```text
I want you to go through the implementation plan and implementation details, looking for areas that could
benefit from additional research as .NET Aspire is a rapidly changing library. For those areas that you identify that
require further research, I want you to update the research document with additional details about the specific
versions that we are going to be using in this Taskify application and spawn parallel research tasks to clarify
any details using research from the web.
```

During this process, you might find that Claude Code gets stuck researching the wrong thing - you can help nudge it in the right direction with a prompt like this:

```text
I think we need to break this down into a series of steps. First, identify a list of tasks
that you would need to do during implementation that you're not sure of or would benefit
from further research. Write down a list of those tasks. And then for each one of these tasks,
I want you to spin up a separate research task so that the net results is we are researching
all of those very specific tasks in parallel. What I saw you doing was it looks like you were
researching .NET Aspire in general and I don't think that's gonna do much for us in this case.
That's way too untargeted research. The research needs to help you solve a specific targeted question.
```

>[!NOTE]
>Claude Code might be over-eager and add components that you did not ask for. Ask it to clarify the rationale and the source of the change.

### **STEP 8:** Have Claude Code validate the plan

With the plan in place, you should have Claude Code run through it to make sure that there are no missing pieces. You can use a prompt like this:

```text
Now I want you to go and audit the implementation plan and the implementation detail files.
Read through it with an eye on determining whether or not there is a sequence of tasks that you need
to be doing that are obvious from reading this. Because I don't know if there's enough here. For example,
when I look at the core implementation, it would be useful to reference the appropriate places in the implementation
details where it can find the information as it walks through each step in the core implementation or in the refinement.
```

This helps refine the implementation plan and helps you avoid potential blind spots that Claude Code missed in its planning cycle. Once the initial refinement pass is complete, ask Claude Code to go through the checklist once more before you can get to the implementation.

You can also ask Claude Code (if you have the [GitHub CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli/github-cli) installed) to go ahead and create a pull request from your current branch to `main` with a detailed description, to make sure that the effort is properly tracked.

>[!NOTE]
>Before you have the agent implement it, it's also worth prompting Claude Code to cross-check the details to see if there are any over-engineered pieces (remember - it can be over-eager). If over-engineered components or decisions exist, you can ask Claude Code to resolve them. Ensure that Claude Code follows the [ground rules](base/memory/ground-rules.md) as the foundational piece that it must adhere to when establishing the plan.

### **STEP 9:** Generate E2E test spec with /personas.design-test

With the implementation plan validated, generate a comprehensive E2E test spec based on user workflows. Use the `/personas.design-test` command to automatically create test scenarios from your quickstart guide:

```text
/personas.design-test
```

This step creates a `design-test.md` file in your feature specification directory that contains:

- **User workflow analysis** - Extracts and analyzes user workflows from quickstart.md
- **E2E test strategy** - Defines E2E test framework, browser coverage, and execution approach (from standards.md)
- **E2E test scenarios** - Generates test cases for each user workflow including happy paths, edge cases, error handling, and alternative paths
- **Test data requirements** - Defines user accounts, fixtures, and mock services needed for testing
- **Test environment requirements** - Specifies infrastructure, browser matrix, and CI/CD integration (from architecture.md)

The generated design-test.md ensures comprehensive E2E testing coverage aligned with your architecture and standards.

### **STEP 10:** Generate task breakdown with /personas.taskify

With the test spec in place, you can now break down the implementation plan into specific, actionable tasks that can be executed in the correct order. Use the `/personas.taskify` command to automatically generate a detailed task breakdown from your implementation plan:

```text
/personas.taskify
```

This step creates a `taskify.md` file in your feature specification directory that contains:

- **Task breakdown organized by user story** - Each user story becomes a separate implementation phase with its own set of tasks
- **Dependency management** - Tasks are ordered to respect dependencies between components (e.g., models before services, services before endpoints)
- **Parallel execution markers** - Tasks that can run in parallel are marked with `[P]` to optimize development workflow
- **File path specifications** - Each task includes the exact file paths where implementation should occur
- **Test-driven development structure** - If tests are requested, test tasks are included and ordered to be written before implementation
- **Checkpoint validation** - Each user story phase includes checkpoints to validate independent functionality

The generated taskify.md provides a clear roadmap for the `/personas.implement` command, ensuring systematic implementation that maintains code quality and allows for incremental delivery of user stories.

### **STEP 11:** Implementation

Once ready, use the `/personas.implement` command to execute your implementation plan:

```text
/personas.implement
```

The `/personas.implement` command will:

- Validate that all prerequisites are in place (ground rules, spec, plan, and tasks)
- Parse the task breakdown from `taskify.md`
- Execute tasks in the correct order, respecting dependencies and parallel execution markers
- Follow the TDD approach defined in your task plan
- Provide progress updates and handle errors appropriately

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The AI agent will execute local CLI commands (such as `dotnet`, `npm`, etc.) - make sure you have the required tools installed on your machine.

Once the implementation is complete, test the application and resolve any runtime errors that may not be visible in CLI logs (e.g., browser console errors). You can copy and paste such errors back to your AI agent for resolution.

### **STEP 12:** Execute E2E tests with /personas.test

After implementation is complete, run E2E tests to validate user workflows. Use the `/personas.test` command to execute tests according to your test spec:

```text
/personas.test
```

The `/personas.test` command will:

- Validate that the test environment matches design-test.md requirements
- Execute E2E tests for all user workflows defined in design-test.md
- Capture test artifacts (screenshots, videos, traces) for failures
- Generate a comprehensive test report in `test-report.md` with:
  - Test results by workflow (pass/fail status)
  - Browser compatibility issues
  - Flaky test identification
  - Performance issues in user workflows
  - Recommendations for fixes and improvements

The test report provides complete traceability from design-test.md to actual test execution results, helping you identify and fix issues before deployment.
