# [ARCHITECTURE ASPECT] Architecture Checklist

**Purpose**: [Brief description of what this architecture checklist validates]
**Created**: [DATE]
**Product Level**: [Mock-up/PoC/MVP/Production]
**Architecture Document**: /d-docs/architecture.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/personas.validate-arch` command based on architecture documentation and validation focus.

<!-- 
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The checklist items below are SAMPLE ITEMS for illustration only.
  
  The /personas.validate-arch command MUST replace these with actual items based on:
  - User's specific validation focus (component design, security, deployment, etc.)
  - Architecture documentation from /d-docs/architecture.md
  - Product level requirements (Mock-up/PoC/MVP/Production)
  - Technology stack and architectural decisions
  
  DO NOT keep these sample items in the generated checklist file.
  Use ARCH### IDs (e.g., ARCH001, ARCH002) for architecture checklist items.
