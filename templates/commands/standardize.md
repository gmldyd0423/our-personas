$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

You are updating the project coding standard at `/d-docs/standards.md`. This file is a TEMPLATE containing placeholder tokens in square brackets (e.g. `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[FRONTEND_FRAMEWORK]`). Your job is to (a) collect/derive concrete values, (b) fill the template precisely for full-stack development, and (c) ensure consistency with the project ground rules.

Follow this execution flow:

1. **Load the existing coding standard template** at `/d-docs/standards.md`.
   - Identify every placeholder token of the form `[ALL_CAPS_IDENTIFIER]`.
   - Note: This template is designed for full-stack development covering frontend, backend, testing, security, performance, DevOps, and database standards.

2. **Detect project technology stack**:
   - Check for `package.json` (Node.js/JavaScript/TypeScript)
   - Check for `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` (Python)
   - Check for `go.mod` (Go)
   - Check for `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` (Java)
   - Check for `Gemfile` (Ruby)
   - Check for `composer.json` (PHP)
   - Check for `Cargo.toml` (Rust)
   - Check existing documentation (README.md, architecture.md, design.md) for tech stack details
   - If multiple technologies detected, ask user which is primary/secondary

3. **Collect/derive values for placeholders**:
   - **Project Information**:
     - `PROJECT_NAME`: From repo name, README, or user input
     - `STANDARD_VERSION`: Start at 1.0.0 or increment from existing
     - `RATIFICATION_DATE`: Original adoption date (ask if unknown)
     - `LAST_AMENDED_DATE`: Today's date if making changes

   - **Frontend Standards** (if frontend detected):
     - `FRONTEND_FRAMEWORK`: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc.
     - `FRONTEND_DESCRIPTION`: Framework-specific best practices
     - `COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE`: Component design patterns

   - **Database Standards**:
     - `SCHEMA_DESIGN`: Schema design principles
     - `MIGRATION_STRATEGY`: Database migration approach
     - `DATA_ACCESS_PATTERNS`: Data access best practices

   - **Project-Specific Standards**:
     - `TECH_STACK_SPECIFIC`: Monorepo, microservices, etc.
     - `DOMAIN_SPECIFIC`: Industry-specific requirements (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR)

   - **Governance**:

   - Preserve heading hierarchy and structure
   - Ensure each section has:
     - Clear, actionable guidelines
     - Specific tools and versions where applicable
     - Measurable criteria (e.g., "80% test coverage" not "good coverage")
     - Examples where helpful
   - Tailor content to detected technology stack
   - Remove sections not applicable to the project (e.g., frontend sections for backend-only projects)

5. **Consistency with project ground rules** (if exists):
   - Read `/memory/ground-rules.md` if it exists
   - Ensure coding standards align with ground rules principles
   - Flag any conflicts between ground rules and coding standards
   - Ensure testing requirements match ground rules' test-first mandates
   - Verify version control and review processes align

6. **Technology-specific recommendations**:

     - ESLint + Prettier configuration
     - TypeScript strict mode
     - Jest/Vitest for testing
     - pnpm/npm/yarn for package management

   - **Python**:
     - Black + isort for formatting

7. **Produce a Sync Impact Report** (prepend as HTML comment):
   - Version change: old → new
   - Technology stack detected
   - Sections filled vs. removed (and why)
   - Alignment with ground rules (if exists)
   - Tool recommendations based on stack
   - Follow-up TODOs if any placeholders deferred

8. **Validation before final output**:
   - No remaining unexplained bracket tokens
   - All guidelines are specific and measurable
   - Version line matches report
   - Dates in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD
   - No vague language (replace "should consider" with "MUST" or "RECOMMENDED")
   - All tools/frameworks mentioned are current and actively maintained
   - Security standards meet industry best practices
   - Performance targets are realistic for the project type

    - New version and bump rationale
    - Technology stack detected and configured for
    - Key standards established (frontend, backend, testing, security)
    - Tools and frameworks configured
    - Any sections removed as not applicable
