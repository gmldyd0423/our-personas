# Specification-Driven Development (SDD)

## The Power Inversion

For decades, code has been king. Specifications served code—they were the scaffolding we built and then discarded once the "real work" of coding began. We wrote PRDs to guide development, created design docs to inform implementation, drew diagrams to visualize architecture. But these were always subordinate to the code itself. Code was truth. Everything else was, at best, good intentions. Code was the source of truth, and as it moved forward, specs rarely kept pace. As the asset (code) and the implementation are one, it's not easy to have a parallel implementation without trying to build from the code.

Spec-Driven Development (SDD) inverts this power structure. Specifications don't serve code—code serves specifications. The Product Requirements Document (PRD) isn't a guide for implementation; it's the source that generates implementation. Technical plans aren't documents that inform coding; they're precise definitions that produce code. This isn't an incremental improvement to how we build software. It's a fundamental rethinking of what drives development.

The gap between specification and implementation has plagued software development since its inception. We've tried to bridge it with better documentation, more detailed requirements, stricter processes. These approaches fail because they accept the gap as inevitable. They try to narrow it but never eliminate it. SDD eliminates the gap by making specifications and their concrete implementation plans born from the specification executable. When specifications and implementation plans generate code, there is no gap—only transformation.

This transformation is now possible because AI can understand and implement complex specifications, and create detailed implementation plans. But raw AI generation without structure produces chaos. SDD provides that structure through specifications and subsequent implementation plans that are precise, complete, and unambiguous enough to generate working systems. The specification becomes the primary artifact. Code becomes its expression (as an implementation from the implementation plan) in a particular language and framework.

In this new world, maintaining software means evolving specifications. The intent of the development team is expressed in natural language ("**intent-driven development**"), design assets, core principles and other guidelines. The **lingua franca** of development moves to a higher level, and code is the last-mile approach.

Debugging means fixing specifications and their implementation plans that generate incorrect code. Refactoring means restructuring for clarity. The entire development workflow reorganizes around specifications as the central source of truth, with implementation plans and code as the continuously regenerated output. Updating apps with new features or creating a new parallel implementation because we are creative beings, means revisiting the specification and creating new implementation plans. This process is therefore a 0 -> 1, (1', ..), 2, 3, N.

The development team focuses in on their creativity, experimentation, their critical thinking.

## The SDD Workflow in Practice

The workflow begins with establishing foundational principles through the `/personas.regulate` command. These principles become the immutable DNA of the project, guiding every subsequent decision. What might take days of meetings and documentation in traditional development happens in minutes of focused principle definition.

For greenfield projects, the workflow continues with a system overview that catalogues all planned features. This comprehensive view enables architectural decisions that consider the entire system scope rather than designing in a vacuum. The `/personas.specify` command transforms vague ideas into structured feature lists with high-level requirements.

The `/personas.clarify` command then resolves ambiguities through structured questioning. The AI identifies edge cases, asks targeted questions, and helps define precise acceptance criteria. This step prevents costly rework downstream by ensuring clear requirements before technical planning begins.

With requirements clarified, the `/personas.architect` command establishes system architecture following ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011 standards. This defines components, technology stack, quality attributes, and infrastructure approach—all while respecting the ground rules principles. The architecture undergoes automated validation through quality checklists, catching issues before they cascade into implementation.

The `/personas.standardize` command then establishes comprehensive coding standards aligned with the architecture. These standards ensure consistent practices across frontend, backend, testing, security, performance, and DevOps. Every standard is measurable and enforceable, with automated checks integrated into CI/CD pipelines.

For individual features, the workflow repeats the specify-clarify cycle to create detailed specifications. The `/personas.design` command then generates implementation designs that map requirements to technical decisions—all guided by the architecture and standards established earlier. Every technology choice has documented rationale. Every architectural decision traces back through the artifact chain: design → architecture → ground rules.

Throughout this process, research agents gather critical context. They investigate library compatibility, performance benchmarks, and security implications. Organizational constraints from the ground rules seamlessly integrate into every specification and plan.

The `/personas.design-test` command generates comprehensive E2E test scenarios from user workflows before any code is written. This ensures tests validate actual user value rather than implementation details. Test scenarios become part of the specification that validates implementations.

The `/personas.taskify` command breaks down implementation plans into executable tasks with dependency management and parallelization markers. Tasks follow the test-first approach defined in the ground rules, ensuring tests are written before implementation code.

The `/personas.analyze` command performs cross-artifact validation, checking alignment between ground rules, specifications, architecture, standards, plans, and tasks. It identifies gaps, contradictions, and missing details—providing a comprehensive readiness assessment before implementation begins.

Code generation through `/personas.implement` follows the validated task list, respecting dependencies and ground rules mandates. Domain concepts become data models. User stories become API endpoints. The implementation executes in the correct order, following TDD when required, with progress tracking throughout.

Finally, `/personas.test` executes the E2E test spec, validating that implementations deliver the promised user value. Test results link back to workflows and requirements, providing complete traceability from specification through validation.

The feedback loop extends beyond initial development. Production metrics and incidents don't just trigger hotfixes—they update specifications and ground rules principles for the next iteration. Performance bottlenecks become new quality attributes in the architecture. Security vulnerabilities become constraints in the standards. This continuous evolution transforms the traditional SDLC from a linear process into a living system where specifications, principles, and implementations co-evolve.

## Why SDD Matters Now

Four trends make SDD not just possible but necessary:

First, AI capabilities have reached a threshold where natural language specifications can reliably generate working code across multiple assistants. The Our Personas toolkit supports over a dozen AI agents—from Claude Code and GitHub Copilot to Cursor, Gemini, Windsurf, and more. This multi-agent approach recognizes that different teams prefer different tools, and the methodology should work across all of them. This isn't about replacing developers—it's about amplifying their effectiveness by automating the mechanical translation from specification to implementation while letting them choose their preferred AI assistant. It amplifies exploration and creativity, supports "start-over" easily, and empowers addition, subtraction, and critical thinking.

Second, software complexity continues to grow exponentially. Modern systems integrate dozens of services, frameworks, and dependencies. Keeping all these pieces aligned with original intent through manual processes becomes increasingly difficult. SDD provides systematic alignment through hierarchical artifact chains—where ground rules principles guide architecture, architecture guides standards, standards guide plans, and plans guide implementation. This creates traceable decisions at every level, with automated validation ensuring consistency. Frameworks may evolve to provide AI-first support, not human-first support, or architect around reusable components.

Third, the pace of change accelerates. Requirements change far more rapidly today than ever before. Pivoting is no longer exceptional—it's expected. Modern product development demands rapid iteration based on user feedback, market conditions, and competitive pressures. Traditional development treats these changes as disruptions. Each pivot requires manually propagating changes through documentation, design, and code. The result is either slow, careful updates that limit velocity, or fast, reckless changes that accumulate technical debt.

SDD transforms requirement changes from obstacles into normal workflow. When specifications drive implementation, pivots become systematic regenerations rather than manual rewrites. Change a ground rules principle, and architecture adapts. Modify architecture, and plans update. Update a user story, and implementation regenerates. The hierarchical workflow means changes cascade through validated artifacts rather than spreading chaos through the codebase. This isn't just about initial development—it's about maintaining engineering velocity through inevitable changes.

Fourth, SDD enables "what-if" exploration and parallel implementation experiments. With specifications as the source of truth, teams can generate multiple implementations from the same requirements—exploring different technology stacks, architectural patterns, or optimization targets. "What if we built this as serverless instead of microservices?" becomes a regeneration exercise rather than a rewrite project. "How would this feature work if we prioritized mobile-first?" becomes a specification adjustment that flows through the workflow. This experimental capacity transforms development from a one-shot commitment into a continuous exploration of the solution space.

## Core Principles

**Ground Rules Governance**: The ground rules become the immutable foundation that guides all development. Project principles, quality standards, and architectural constraints are established first and inform every subsequent decision. This provides consistency across time, teams, and implementations.

**Hierarchical Artifact Chain**: Development follows a validated sequence where each artifact builds on the previous: Ground Rules → Architecture → Standards → Specification → Plan → Tasks → Implementation → Tests. Each level provides constraints and guidance for the next, creating traceable decisions throughout.

**Specifications as the Lingua Franca**: Feature specifications become the primary communication artifact. Code becomes their expression in a particular language and framework. Maintaining software means evolving specifications, with implementation as the continuously regenerated output.

**Architecture-First Development**: System architecture precedes feature implementation. This ensures individual features fit into a coherent whole, with technology choices, quality attributes, and infrastructure approach defined before building begins.

**Standards-Driven Consistency**: Comprehensive coding standards—covering testing, security, performance, and DevOps—ensure uniform practices across the entire codebase. Standards are measurable, enforceable, and automated through CI/CD pipelines.

**Executable Specifications**: Specifications must be precise, complete, and unambiguous enough to generate working systems. This eliminates the gap between intent and implementation by making specifications the direct driver of code generation.

**Continuous Refinement**: Consistency validation happens continuously through automated checklists and cross-artifact analysis. AI analyzes specifications for ambiguity, contradictions, and gaps as an ongoing process, not as a one-time gate.

**Multi-View Stakeholder Concerns**: Architecture addresses concerns of all stakeholders—developers, operations, product, QA, security—through multiple architectural views. Trade-offs are explicit and documented, ensuring balanced decisions.

**Research-Driven Context**: Research agents gather critical context throughout the specification process, investigating technical options, performance implications, and organizational constraints. Decisions are informed by real data rather than assumptions.

**Test-First Validation**: E2E test specs are generated from user workflows before implementation begins. Tests validate that implementations deliver promised user value, with complete traceability from requirements through test results.

**Bidirectional Feedback**: Production reality informs specification evolution. Metrics, incidents, and operational learnings become inputs for specification refinement, ground rules updates, and architectural improvements.

**Multi-Agent Flexibility**: The methodology works across diverse AI assistants—Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Gemini, Windsurf, and more. Teams choose their preferred tools while maintaining consistent structure and practices.

**Branching for Exploration**: Generate multiple implementation approaches from the same specification to explore different optimization targets—performance, maintainability, user experience, cost—or different technology stacks entirely.

**Traditional Approach:**

```text
1. Define project principles (1-2 hours of meetings)
2. Write a PRD in a document (2-3 hours)
3. Create architecture documents (4-6 hours)
4. Define coding standards (2-3 hours)
5. Write technical specifications (3-4 hours)
6. Create test specs (2 hours)
7. Break down into tasks manually (2-3 hours)
8. Set up project structure manually (1 hour)
Total: ~20-25 hours of documentation and planning work
```

**SDD with Complete Command Workflow:**

```bash

- **SDD with Commands**: 1-1.5 hours of structured workflow
- **Time Saved**: 85-90% reduction in planning overhead
- **Quality Improvement**: Comprehensive, consistent documentation with automated validation

### The Power of Structured Automation

The command workflow doesn't just save time—it enforces architectural discipline and quality:

1. **Ground Rules Governance**: Every decision traces back to established principles
2. **Architectural Consistency**: System design guides all feature implementations
3. **Standards Compliance**: Coding practices are uniform across the entire codebase
4. **No Forgotten Details**: Templates ensure comprehensive coverage from requirements to testing
5. **Traceable Decisions**: Every technical choice links back through plan → architecture → ground rules
6. **Living Documentation**: Specifications stay in sync with code because they drive implementation
7. **Quality Validation**: Automated checklist validation catches issues before implementation
8. **Rapid Iteration**: Change requirements at any level and regenerate downstream artifacts in minutes

The commands embody SDD principles by treating the entire development process—from principles to implementation—as a structured, executable workflow. They transform specification from a necessary documentation burden into the systematic driver of high-quality development.

### Template-Driven Quality: How Structure Constrains LLMs for Better Outcomes

The true power of the command workflow lies not just in automation, but in how the templates guide LLM behavior toward higher-quality specifications and implementations. The templates act as sophisticated prompts that constrain the LLM's output in productive ways:

#### 1. **Hierarchical Workflow Enforcement**

The command sequence enforces proper abstraction levels and timing:

```text
Regulate → Specify → Clarify → Architect → Standardize → Plan → Design-Test → Tasks → Analyze → Implement → Test
```

This prevents common failures:

- ❌ Planning before establishing principles (no guiding constraints)
- ❌ Implementation before architecture (no system context)
- ❌ Coding before standards (inconsistent practices)
- ✅ Each step builds on validated foundations

The workflow ensures that:

- **Principles precede decisions**: Ground rules define "why" before any "how"
- **Architecture precedes implementation**: System design guides feature development
- **Standards precede coding**: Consistent practices applied uniformly
- **Planning precedes execution**: Detailed roadmap before building
- **Testing validates workflows**: E2E tests confirm user value delivery

#### 2. **Preventing Premature Implementation Details**

The feature specification template explicitly instructs:

```text
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
```

This constraint forces the LLM to maintain proper abstraction levels. When an LLM might naturally jump to "implement using React with Redux," the template keeps it focused on "users need real-time updates of their data." This separation ensures specifications remain stable even as implementation technologies change.

The architecture command then bridges the gap:

- Specification stays technology-agnostic
- Architecture defines system-level technology choices
- Standards establish implementation practices
- Plan applies technologies to specific features

#### 3. **Ground Rules Compliance Gates**

The ground rules act as the immutable foundation that all other documents must respect:

```text
Every decision in architecture, standards, plan, and implementation must align with ground rules.
```

For example, if the ground rules mandate:

- **Article I: Library-First Principle** → Plan must structure features as libraries
- **Article III: Test-First Imperative** → Tasks must include tests before implementation
- **Article VII: Simplicity Gate** → Architecture must justify any complexity beyond 3 projects

The workflow automatically enforces these principles:

- Architecture checklist validates ground rules compliance
- Plan references ground rules for decisions
- Tasks follow test-first mandate from ground rules
- Implementation cannot proceed without passing gates

#### 4. **Forcing Explicit Uncertainty Markers**

Both specification and planning templates mandate the use of `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers:

```text
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something, mark it
```

This prevents the common LLM behavior of making plausible but potentially incorrect assumptions. Instead of guessing that a "login system" uses email/password authentication, the LLM must mark it as `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]`.

The `/personas.clarify` command then systematically resolves these markers before architecture begins.

#### 5. **Structured Thinking Through Checklists**

Templates include comprehensive checklists that act as "unit tests" for artifacts:

```markdown
### Requirement Completeness
- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
```

These checklists force the LLM to self-review its output systematically, catching gaps that might otherwise slip through. It's like giving the LLM a quality assurance framework.

The `/personas.analyze` command performs cross-artifact validation using these checklists.

#### 6. **Product Level Awareness**

Architecture and standards templates adapt guidance based on product maturity:

```markdown
Product Level: [Mock-up / PoC / MVP / Production]

- Mock-up: Simple single-component, focus on UI/UX flows
- PoC: Core components only, prove technical feasibility  
- MVP: Essential components, vertical scaling, designed for horizontal growth
- Production: Complete architecture, multi-region, comprehensive security
```

This prevents over-engineering for early-stage projects and ensures production-ready quality for mature systems. The LLM learns to scale architectural complexity appropriately.

#### 7. **Multi-View Stakeholder Concerns**

Architecture template enforces ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011 standards:

```markdown
### Stakeholder Concerns
- Developers: Maintainability, testability, modularity
- Operations: Deployability, scalability, observability
- Product: Feature velocity, time-to-market
- QA: Testability, debuggability
- Security: Threat surface, compliance
```

This prevents developer-centric designs that ignore operational or business concerns. The LLM must explicitly address how the architecture serves all stakeholders.

#### 8. **Technology-Specific Best Practices**

Standards template provides ecosystem-appropriate guidance:

```markdown
For Node.js/TypeScript:
- ESLint + Prettier for code quality
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Jest/Vitest for testing
- pnpm for package management

For Python:
- Black + isort for formatting
- Pylint/Flake8 for linting
- pytest for testing
- Poetry for dependencies
```

This ensures the LLM recommends appropriate tools and patterns for each technology stack, avoiding generic advice that doesn't fit the ecosystem.

#### 9. **Hierarchical Detail Management**

The templates enforce proper information architecture:

```text
**IMPORTANT**: This implementation plan should remain high-level and readable.
Any code samples, detailed algorithms, or extensive technical specifications
must be placed in the appropriate `implementation-details/` file
```

This prevents the common problem of specifications becoming unreadable code dumps. The LLM learns to maintain appropriate detail levels, extracting complexity to separate files while keeping the main document navigable.

#### 10. **Test-First Thinking**

The workflow enforces test-driven development:

```text
### File Creation Order (from taskify.md)
1. Create `contracts/` with API specifications
2. Create test files in order: contract → integration → e2e → unit
3. Create source files to make tests pass
```

This ordering constraint ensures the LLM thinks about testability and contracts before implementation, leading to more robust and verifiable code.

The `/personas.design-test` command creates comprehensive E2E scenarios before implementation begins, and `/personas.test` validates them after.

#### 11. **Cross-Artifact Consistency**

The `/personas.analyze` command validates alignment across all artifacts:

- Requirements in spec.md → Addressed in design.md
- User stories in spec.md → Test scenarios in design-test.md
- Architecture decisions → Referenced in design.md
- Ground rules → Applied in architecture and standards
- Coding standards → Followed in plan and tasks

This creates a web of accountability where every artifact reinforces and validates the others.

#### 12. **Preventing Speculative Features**

Templates explicitly discourage speculation:

```text
- [ ] No speculative or "might need" features
- [ ] All phases have clear prerequisites and deliverables
```

This stops the LLM from adding "nice to have" features that complicate implementation. Every feature must trace back to a concrete user story with clear acceptance criteria.

### The Compound Effect

These constraints work together to produce a complete development workflow that is:

- **Principled**: Ground rules provide unchanging foundation
- **Complete**: Checklists ensure nothing is forgotten
- **Unambiguous**: Forced clarification markers highlight uncertainties
- **Testable**: Test-first thinking baked into the process
- **Maintainable**: Proper abstraction levels and information hierarchy
- **Implementable**: Clear phases with concrete deliverables
- **Stakeholder-Aware**: Addresses concerns of all project participants
- **Technology-Appropriate**: Ecosystem-specific best practices
- **Quality-Validated**: Automated checklist validation at each step
- **Traceable**: Every decision links back through the artifact chain

The templates transform the LLM from a creative writer into a disciplined systems engineer, channeling its capabilities toward producing consistently high-quality, executable specifications and implementations that truly drive development from principles through delivery.

## The Foundational Rules: Enforcing Architectural Discipline

At the heart of SDD lies a ground-rule set of immutable principles that govern how specifications become code. The ground rules (`memory/ground-rules.md`) act as the architectural DNA of the system, ensuring that every generated implementation maintains consistency, simplicity, and quality.

### The Nine Articles of Development

The ground rules define nine articles that shape every aspect of the development process:

#### Article I: Library-First Principle

Every feature must begin as a standalone library—no exceptions. This forces modular design from the start:

```text
Every feature in Personas MUST begin its existence as a standalone library.
No feature shall be implemented directly within application code without
first being abstracted into a reusable library component.
```

This principle ensures that specifications generate modular, reusable code rather than monolithic applications. When the LLM generates an implementation plan, it must structure features as libraries with clear boundaries and minimal dependencies.

#### Article II: CLI Interface Mandate

Every library must expose its functionality through a command-line interface:

```text
All CLI interfaces MUST:
- Accept text as input (via stdin, arguments, or files)
- Produce text as output (via stdout)
- Support JSON format for structured data exchange
```

This enforces observability and testability. The LLM cannot hide functionality inside opaque classes—everything must be accessible and verifiable through text-based interfaces.

#### Article III: Test-First Imperative

The most transformative article—no code before tests:

```text
This is NON-NEGOTIABLE: All implementation MUST follow strict Test-Driven Development.
No implementation code shall be written before:
1. Unit tests are written
2. Tests are validated and approved by the user
3. Tests are confirmed to FAIL (Red phase)
```

This completely inverts traditional AI code generation. Instead of generating code and hoping it works, the LLM must first generate comprehensive tests that define behavior, get them approved, and only then generate implementation.

#### Articles VII & VIII: Simplicity and Anti-Abstraction

These paired articles combat over-engineering:

```text
Section 7.3: Minimal Project Structure
- Maximum 3 projects for initial implementation
- Additional projects require documented justification

Section 8.1: Framework Trust
- Use framework features directly rather than wrapping them
```

When an LLM might naturally create elaborate abstractions, these articles force it to justify every layer of complexity. The implementation plan template's "Phase -1 Gates" directly enforce these principles.

#### Article IX: Integration-First Testing

Prioritizes real-world testing over isolated unit tests:

```text
Tests MUST use realistic environments:
- Prefer real databases over mocks
- Use actual service instances over stubs
- Contract tests mandatory before implementation
```

This ensures generated code works in practice, not just in theory.

### Ground Rules Enforcement Through Templates

The implementation plan template operationalizes these articles through concrete checkpoints:

```markdown
### Phase -1: Pre-Implementation Gates
#### Simplicity Gate (Article VII)
- [ ] Using ≤3 projects?
- [ ] No future-proofing?

#### Anti-Abstraction Gate (Article VIII)
- [ ] Using framework directly?
- [ ] Single model representation?

#### Integration-First Gate (Article IX)
- [ ] Contracts defined?
- [ ] Contract tests written?
```

These gates act as compile-time checks for architectural principles. The LLM cannot proceed without either passing the gates or documenting justified exceptions in the "Complexity Tracking" section.

### The Power of Immutable Principles

The ground rules' power lies in its immutability. While implementation details can evolve, the core principles remain constant. This provides:

1. **Consistency Across Time**: Code generated today follows the same principles as code generated next year
2. **Consistency Across LLMs**: Different AI models produce architecturally compatible code
3. **Architectural Integrity**: Every feature reinforces rather than undermines the system design
4. **Quality Guarantees**: Test-first, library-first, and simplicity principles ensure maintainable code

### Ground Rules Evolution

While principles are immutable, their application can evolve:

```text
Section 4.2: Amendment Process
Modifications to this ground-rules file require:
- Explicit documentation of the rationale for change
- Review and approval by project maintainers
- Backwards compatibility assessment
```

This allows the methodology to learn and improve while maintaining stability. The ground rules file shows its own evolution with dated amendments, demonstrating how principles can be refined based on real-world experience.

### Beyond Rules: A Development Philosophy

The ground rules file isn't just a rulebook—it's a philosophy that shapes how LLMs think about code generation:

- **Observability Over Opacity**: Everything must be inspectable through CLI interfaces
- **Simplicity Over Cleverness**: Start simple, add complexity only when proven necessary
- **Integration Over Isolation**: Test in real environments, not artificial ones
- **Modularity Over Monoliths**: Every feature is a library with clear boundaries

By embedding these principles into the specification and planning process, SDD ensures that generated code isn't just functional—it's maintainable, testable, and architecturally sound. The ground rules transform AI from a code generator into an architectural partner that respects and reinforces system design principles.

## The Transformation

This isn't about replacing developers or automating creativity. It's about amplifying human capability by automating mechanical translation. It's about creating a tight feedback loop where specifications, research, and code evolve together, each iteration bringing deeper understanding and better alignment between intent and implementation.

Software development needs better tools for maintaining alignment between intent and implementation. SDD provides the methodology for achieving this alignment through executable specifications that generate code rather than merely guiding it.
