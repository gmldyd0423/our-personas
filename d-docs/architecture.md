# Software Architecture Design

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace placeholders to describe the purpose of this architecture document.
-->

The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive and formal description of the software architecture for **[System Name]**. It defines the high-level structure, components, and relationships of the system, addressing the key concerns of project stakeholders. This document serves as a blueprint for all development activities and a guide for understanding the system's design principles, constraints, and trade-offs.

### 1.2 Scope
<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define the scope of the architecture covered in this document.
-->

This document covers the architectural design of the **[System Name]** software, which aims to **[briefly describe the system's purpose]**. The architecture is described through a set of defined views, chosen to address specific stakeholder concerns. This document does not delve into low-level implementation details, which will be covered in a separate Software Design Description (SDD).

### 1.3 Product Level
<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Select the appropriate product level for this architecture.
  This determines the architectural complexity and completeness required.
-->

This architectural design is for a **[select one: Mock-up, Proof of Concept (PoC), Minimum Viable Product (MVP), Full-fledged Production]** version of the product.

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Specify your current product level and document the architectural implications.
-->

**Current Product Level**: **[Specify the current level, e.g., "MVP"]**

**Architectural Implications**:

* **Scope**: **[Describe architectural scope, e.g., "For PoC, focus on core components only; microservices architecture deferred to MVP"]**
* **Quality Attributes**: **[Note quality priorities, e.g., "For MVP, prioritize functional completeness over performance optimization; Production requires comprehensive security hardening"]**
* **Infrastructure**: **[Note infrastructure implications, e.g., "PoC uses single-server deployment; Production requires multi-region, high-availability setup"]**
* **Scalability**: **[Note scalability approach, e.g., "MVP designed for vertical scaling; Production requires horizontal scaling capabilities"]**

## 2. Architectural Representation
<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Map stakeholders to their concerns and define which architectural views will address them.
-->

### 2.1 Stakeholders and Concerns

The following table maps key stakeholders to their primary concerns, which this architectural description will address.

| Stakeholder | Primary Concerns |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Product Manager** | Business value, features, cost, time-to-market. |
| **Developers** | Technology choices, component interactions, APIs, maintainability. |
| **System Administrators** | Deployment, scalability, performance, monitoring, security. |
| **QA/Testers** | Testability, reliability, behavior under load. |
| **Security Team** | Data protection, access control, threat mitigation. |

### 2.2 Architectural Views

The architecture will be described using the following views, each chosen to address specific stakeholder concerns:

* **Logical View**: Addresses developer and product manager concerns by showing the system's functional decomposition.
* **Process View**: Addresses developer and administrator concerns by detailing the runtime structure and concurrency.
* **Deployment View**: Addresses administrator concerns by mapping software to physical hardware and infrastructure.
* **Data View**: Addresses developer and data specialist concerns by describing the data architecture.

## 3. Architectural Goals and Constraints
<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define the business goals, quality attributes, and constraints that shape the architecture.
-->

### 3.1 Business Goals

The architecture is designed to support the following business objectives:

* **[Goal 1]**: [e.g., "Enable rapid iteration and feature delivery."]
* **[Goal 2]**: [e.g., "Achieve a high level of availability to minimize service disruption."]
* **[Goal 3]**: [e.g., "Ensure a secure platform for handling sensitive customer data."]

### 3.2 Quality Attributes (Non-Functional Requirements)

The architecture is specifically designed to meet the following non-functional requirements:

* **Performance**: The system must achieve a p95 response time of under **[500ms]** for all critical API calls.
* **Scalability**: The system must be able to scale horizontally to handle a **[3x]** increase in user traffic over the next year.
* **Security**: All customer data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.
* **Availability**: The system must maintain a **[99.99%]** uptime.

### 3.3 Design Constraints

The architectural design is subject to the following constraints:

* **Technology**: The primary technology stack must be **[e.g., Python, AWS, PostgreSQL]**.
* **Budget**: The monthly cloud hosting cost must not exceed **[$X,XXX]**.
* **Legacy Integration**: The new system must be able to securely read data from the existing **[e.g., legacy mainframe system]**.

## 4. Architectural Views

### 4.1 Logical View (Component Diagram)

This view shows the system's primary components, their responsibilities, and the main interactions between them.

![Logical View Diagram](https://example.com/logical-view.png)

* **[Component A]**: [e.g., "User Management Service"] - Manages all user-related data and authentication.
* **[Component B]**: [e.g., "Catalog Service"] - Manages product information and inventory.
* **[Component C]**: [e.g., "Order Service"] - Handles the business logic for processing and fulfilling orders.
* **[Component D]**: [e.g., "Payment Gateway Adapter"] - An interface to a third-party payment processor.

### 4.2 Process View

This view describes the runtime structure of the system, detailing how components interact and manage concurrency.

![Process View Diagram](https://example.com/process-view.png)

* **Concurrency**: The system will use a multi-process, multi-threaded model. Each service will be a separate process, and each process will use multiple threads to handle concurrent requests.
* **Inter-Process Communication**: Communication between services will be handled via **[e.g., RESTful APIs, asynchronous message queues (RabbitMQ)]**.

### 4.3 Deployment View

This view illustrates how the software components are physically deployed onto the hardware infrastructure.

![Deployment View Diagram](https://example.com/deployment-view.png)

* **Infrastructure**: The system will be hosted on **[e.g., AWS]**.
* **Deployment Strategy**: Each service will be containerized using Docker and orchestrated by Kubernetes for automated scaling and management.
* **Load Balancing**: An Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) will distribute incoming traffic across multiple service instances.

### 4.4 Data View

This view describes the system's data architecture, including data stores and their relationships.

![Data View Diagram](https://example.com/data-view.png)

* **Data Stores**:
  * **[Data Store 1]**: [e.g., "PostgreSQL Database"] - Used for storing structured, relational data such as user and order information.
  * **[Data Store 2]**: [e.g., "Redis Cache"] - Used for in-memory caching of frequently accessed data to improve performance.

## 5. Architectural Decisions

### 5.1 Key Decisions and Rationale

* **Decision**: To adopt a **microservices** architectural style.
* **Rationale**: This approach addresses the scalability and maintainability goals by allowing services to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. It also provides fault isolation.

* **Decision**: To use **[RabbitMQ]** for asynchronous communication between services.
* **Rationale**: This decision supports the performance and reliability goals by decoupling services, allowing them to process tasks without waiting for immediate responses.

### 5.2 Design Alternatives and Trade-offs

* **Alternative**: A monolithic architecture was considered.
* **Trade-offs**: While a monolith would be simpler to develop and deploy initially, it would not meet the long-term scalability and maintainability goals. Changes to one part of the system would risk affecting the entire application.

## 6. Architectural Policies and Patterns

### 6.1 System-Wide Policies

* **Error Handling**: All services must use a standard logging library and log errors to a centralized log management system (e.g., ELK Stack).
* **Security**: All APIs must be protected with an authentication and authorization layer. Secrets (e.g., API keys, database passwords) must be stored in a secure vault (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager).

### 6.2 Design Patterns

* **[Pattern 1]**: [e.g., "Circuit Breaker"] - Applied to inter-service calls to prevent cascading failures.
* **[Pattern 2]**: [e.g., "Saga Pattern"] - Used for managing distributed transactions across multiple services.
